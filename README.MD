# Wicked Good Websites

This is a site for showcasing wicked good websites from across the internet. It features searching, sorting, and filtering, as well as user accounts for favoriting sites and submitting suggestions for new ones.

The frontend (`/client`) uses SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind, and talks to a GraphQL API. The backend (`/server`) exposes that GraphQL API and uses Keystone as a CMS.
